## Where You Are Now

**Why do I need a job?**

I want to have my own place of live and be self-sustained. Eventually, I want to be locationally independent and be able to live or travel where I please. Ideally, I don’t want to have to worry about money.

**What kind of salary level do I need to sustain myself and my family?**

When I start out, depending on where I’m living, anywhere from __ to __ would be ideal. In the long run, I’d take a job with less hours and more freedom any day, as long as the salary was still enough for me to live comfortably.

**What kind of job security level do I need to sustain myself?**

I don’t particularly care about job security beyond knowing I’ll get a steady income for 6 months - 1 year.

**How desperate am I to get a job right now?**

Not desperate, but not content either. I don’t like inactivity.

## Where You Want To Be

**Why do I want a job in web development?**

I enjoy the combination of skills required to do web development, and I believe it matches my own skillset and interests quite well. I also think the web hasn't even begun to reach its full potential, and being along for the ride as the internet of things, big data, and machine learning take off will certainly be exciting.

If nothing else, web development is a field that not only encourages by necessitates continual learning, 

**What kind of career path do I want to have?**

A varied one, which incorporates a lot of different abilities and insights from multiple fields. I enjoy journalism, media, technology, travel, and a host of other things, and the more I enjoy them the more I see parallels and similarities between them. I think I'd be putting my talents to waste if I pigeonholed myself into one market.

**Do I want to work in a developer-led organization (vs sales- or business-led)?**

**Do I prefer working in a team environment or remotely?**

**Do I like working long hours / weekends or 9-6?**

I could for a period of my life, but for the indefinite future? Absolutely not. It's been proven time and time again that [too much work results in negative productivity,](http://lengstorf.com/overtime-hurts-productivity/?utm_source=medium-com&utm_medium=negative-productivity&utm_campaign=overkill-cult) *especially* when the work involved is heavily creative — which web development certainly is.

Indeed, I believe a majority of high-quality creative work is done is short 3 or 4 hour bursts. 

**Is the work more important than the people?**

No. Work is never separate from people unless you delude yourself into thinking so. You are either working for someone or working for yourself, and in both cases you should view the work as a means to an end and not the end in itself. Whether you're creating a beautiful website, a complex algorithm, or a silly mobile game, your goal should be to create something of quality, something worthwhile, because it is these things that people can appreciate.

**Do I have to care about the product I'm building?**

Yes, I don't think I could do excellent work on a product I don't care about.

**Do I have to care about the technologies I'm using?**

**Do I prefer an "easy" work environment or one where I'm constantly pushed?**

**Do I want "creature comfort" incentives like free food and beer at the office?**

**Do I have to enjoy my work or can I power through a crappy job?**

> You should have at least an informal list of the things that matter to you. Now ruthlessly rank them. What are your non-negotiables and what are your nice-to-haves? Every company and opportunity will fall somewhere on the spectrum defined by those questions and they are the criteria you will later use to evaluate them. This will help you stay focused when considering opportunities and not spread yourself too thin chasing things that you wouldn't really choose anyway.
> Make sure you know every one of your "must-haves" and your top 5 priorities for "nice-to-haves" in a job.
